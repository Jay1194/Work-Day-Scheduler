# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
I've developed a user-friendly calendar app that lets you save events for each hour of the day. The app is browser-based and uses jQuery for dynamic updates. Notably, the time slots are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. This makes it easy to quickly understand the timing of your events at a glance.
